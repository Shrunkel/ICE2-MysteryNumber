The creation of this game was interesting. Although the idea of it being a simple random number guessing game, the practice to execute it was a nightmare. There were not any hassles when designing this game, especially in the process of what we have done in psuedocode.
There were not much challenges, the only nightmare was the internal thought of "What am i doing" and the ocassional bug of the feedback not being displayed when asked to. In all other aspects i faced no trouble.
For this app, i was helped with a friend. He helped me with certain things i struggled with. Thats all. yeah
